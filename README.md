Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase some of the projects I've been working on over the past few years.

This includes security and self-hosted projects such as:

SIEM – Wazuh
Self-hosted Wiki – Wiki.js
Self-hosted DNS – AdGuard
Home Network Setup – VLAN configurations
Home Automation – Home Assistant
Interactive Dashboard – Homarr for centralized organization

Along the way, I'll also be sharing security configurations and best practices to enhance system security and efficiency.
